## Status

This Webinizer webclient frontend is a WPE pathfinding project and as such is not yet suitable for
broad usage. Support bandwidth is limited, and we will focus on well documented [issues], ideally
with test cases. We always welcome contributions, for more detail see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Caveat Emptor.
